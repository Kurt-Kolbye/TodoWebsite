# TodoWebsite

## Goal
I built out an API [here](https://github.com/Kurt-Kolbye/TodoApi) that allows updates to ToDo records and assigning Labels to To Dos.

This project is a minimal front-end application using HTML, JavaScript (with some jQuery), and [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/) for accessing the API.

## Experience Gained
The project gave me experience and insights into:

* accessing an API from a website decoupled from the API,
* how CORS policies work,
* and using [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/) to organize operations and display data.

## Summary

Overall, this project was good for overcoming CORS policy challenges and getting more familiar with [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/).
